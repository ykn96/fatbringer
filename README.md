- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @ykn96
- Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering (Highest Distinction) from the National University of Singapore in 2021
- Second major in Innovation and Design 
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Aritificial Intelligence, Information Fusion, Robotics and Medicine (though I wonder how do I get there? Should i do an MD? I had a 516 (130/128/129/129) on the MCAT from 2022)
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning something... learning everything... learning computer science ... learning computer vision ... learning machine learning ... learning linear algebra ... learning basic math ... learning how to keep fit and healthy ... learning how to cook and eat well!
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on everything. Because many brains together work better!
- üì´ How to reach me here at < drop an issue maybe?>

# Skills and Technologies
Due to the spread of my projects, I, for good or bad, have more breadth than depth in the stuff below. 

## Programming languages
C, C++, Python, Java, Kotlin   
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c,cpp,py,java,kotlin)](https://skillicons.dev)      

## Tools
Different projects call for different tools, and I slowly picked them up over time   
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vscode,androidstudio,sublime,anaconda,sqlite)](https://skillicons.dev)    

As a mechanical engineer, I am also trained in mechanical design tools and software. I also do 3D printing!
- Solidworks, Fusion360, OnShape
- 3D Printing: Cura, Flashforge

## Libraries, Frameworks etc. 
I mostly use pretrained models provided by others that uses pytorch    
opencv is a staple.    
Numpy is a staple under the hood

## Hardware
Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson TX2, NVIDIA AGX, DJI Manifold 2

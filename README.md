- 👋 Hi, I’m @fatbringer (YKN)
- Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from the National University of Singapore in 2021
- Second major in Innovation and Design 
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Aritificial Intelligence, Information Fusion, Robotics and Medicine (though I wonder how do I get there?)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning something... learning everything
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything. Because many brains together work better!

# Skills and Technologies
Due to the spread of my projects, I, for good or bad, have more breadth than depth in the stuff below. 

## Programming languages
C, C++, Python, Java, Kotlin   
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c,cpp,py,java,kotlin)](https://skillicons.dev)      

## Tools
Different projects call for different tools, and I slowly picked them up over time

As a mechanical engineer, I am also trained in mechanical design tools and software. I also do 3D printing!
- Solidworks, Fusion360, OnShape
- 3D Printing: Cura, Flashforge

## Libraries, Frameworks etc. 
I mostly use pretrained models provided by others that uses pytorch    
opencv is a staple.    
Numpy is a staple under the hood

## Hardware
Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson TX2, AGX

# Papers, please
I was blessed with the opportunity to co-author several research papers. I love my work!      
**Data fusion pipeline for UAV-Based Real-Time Night Crowd Counting for Public Safety** at International Conference on Information Fusion 2024   
**Integrated Raman sensor smart robot for swift and remote on-site forensic analysis** at SPIE 2024
